# MeFirst
The explaination of this website is a place where users can use a form to write questions about their skin concerns.
Other users then can help them out by replying above them with helpul suggestions.They will do this in the browse tab.
Users can also find out their skintype by selecting SkinType in the nav bar where there will be explainations on their skin. 
I have also created a treatments models where there will be treatments avilable to users for their various skin problems. 


I added a [KEY] over my primary key because it would not run otherwise.
